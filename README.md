# Overview
As AI becomes increasingly involved in decision processes, it will be important to deal with Bias in AI. This is an investigation of one method to debias a dataset. 
## Assignment
- 1st part:
In this project I implemented a data debiasing algorithm proposed by Feldman (refer to 2015FeldmanM.pdf). In the project report I first mention why I implemented this particular debiasing algorithm. Then I describe the data I used to test the debiasing algorithm and specifically how I implemented the algorithm. Finally I compare my results with Feldman's. Please find my full report in final-submission/projectreport_coursework.pdf.
- 2nd part:
In the second part I discuss about the future of Bias in AI by first talking about the paper "Artificial Intelligence: A Threat to Strategic Stability" by J. Johnson and then using other sources to express my opinion. Please find my full essay in final-submission/essay_coursework.pdf.
